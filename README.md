**NOTE :** This template is temporary.

#### Current Commit: 
 - style, css, sass loader added
 - Uses pug as a template
 - HMR enabled 
 - Eslint enabled
 - No so much optimization only code splitting (chunks)
 - Major use for inline styling
 - React-Redux setup
 - Babel 7
 - `styles` folder under `src/` was created in case for using css, sass, less or anything for styling
 - `webpack.config.js` is still temporary this template is heavily focused on `webpack.config.dev.js`
 - in **eslint-loader** options in `webpack.config.dev.js` `emitWarning` option is set to true to avoid the program to stop when an eslint error detected
